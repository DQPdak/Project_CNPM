# Progress Interaction Audit

This note records manual checks for the editor progress workflow after the
latest frontend and backend merge.

## Scope

- Editor login flow with the seeded Tantou Editor account.
- Assigned series list, search, status filters, and chapter navigation.
- Studio progress filters, dashboard summaries, task cards, and workspace links.
- Task status updates through the progress board.

## Baseline

- Backend runs on port 5000.
- Frontend runs on port 5173.
- Development data is seeded from the in-memory MongoDB fallback.
- The editor account used for local verification is `editor@example.com`.

## Current Result

- Series list loads from the backend.
- Progress board loads series, chapters, annotations, and task counts.
- Workspace links stay inside the authenticated app session.
- Task status changes update both the Kanban columns and dashboard metrics.

## Series Page Checklist

- Open `/editor/series` from the Tantou Editor sidebar.
- Confirm the summary counters render after backend data loads.
- Confirm the list contains the seeded editor series.
- Search by a Vietnamese title fragment such as `Rồng`.
- Clear the search field and confirm the full list returns.
- Apply the `ACTIVE` filter and confirm active series remain visible.
- Open a chapter list from a series card.
- Confirm the chapter list route receives the selected series id.
- Confirm chapter action links render for page management and publish review.
- Return to the series list through navigation without losing auth state.

## Progress Page Checklist

- Open `/editor/progress` from the Tantou Editor sidebar.
- Confirm the series selector lists all editor-visible series.
- Confirm the chapter selector updates when the selected series changes.
- Confirm the default chapter selection shows annotation and task metrics.
- Select `Tất cả các chương` and confirm aggregate metrics do not reset to zero.
- Click `Tải lại dữ liệu` and confirm the selected filters remain stable.
- Open a task `Workspace` link and confirm the workspace route keeps auth state.
- Return to the progress board and confirm the board still renders.

## Status Update Checklist

- Locate a task card with a visible status selector.
- Change a task from a done state to `Đang vẽ`.
- Confirm the task moves to the in-progress column.
- Confirm the dashboard completion percentage and counts update.
- Change the same task back to its original status.
- Confirm the dashboard and columns return to their prior values.

## Follow-Up Notes

- Dashboard counts should be checked after every status update.
- Workspace navigation should remain a client-side route change.
- Mobile layout should be checked when changing the board controls.
- Mongoose deprecation warnings are non-blocking but worth cleaning later.
